# Yummier backend

## How to get started:
- Build application `./gradlew bootJar`
- Change directory into main project `cd ..`
- Dockerize the app `docker compose up --build`

Backend is exposed at localhost:8080

Now when you want to run it again, you can simply turn on the docker container. 

⚠️ After each backend change, you will need to re-build and re-dockerize it.
